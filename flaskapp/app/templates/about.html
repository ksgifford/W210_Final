  <p class="narrative">Photos uploaded to CritterCounter are held on a private S3
    bucket on Amazon Web Services. Users have the option to purge their data after
    classification, entirely removing it from CritterCounter databases and file
    storage. If desired, photos can be shared as open source and to help build out
    species range maps and add to our classification training data set.</p>
